# Personal-Projects
These are a couple of projects I worked on throughout my undergrad (in class and out of class). These projects include different languages such as SQL, Python, and R-programming. For the python projects, they were all completed on JupyterHub so I have included a .ipynb file for each of those projects. For the R-programming files I have included a .rmd file that can be run through R-Studio. Hope you enjoy!
